					<p>As a hybrid UI/UX designer with a robust foundation in front-end development (ReactJS, Angular, Astro Build) and graphic design (visual identity, illustration, native & web UI/UX), I'm passionate about blending creativity with technology. My drive for crafting intuitive user experiences and visually captivating interfaces sets me apart. I'm eager to take on a new challenge where I can lead creative teams, push the boundaries of design, and contribute to the success of forward-thinking organizations. Let's build something extraordinary together.</p>

                    <p>With over two decades of experience, I started web development as a hobby in 1998, turning professional by 2002. My passion for design grew, leading me to interface design by 2014 and user experience expertise by 2016. As a freelancer, I've created custom applications for small businesses, blending creativity with technical skill.</p>
                    <p>My journey in illustration began in childhood, evolving into professional work by 2006. In 2012, I shifted from web design to programming user interfaces and front-end development, combining artistry with technical precision for engaging digital experiences.</p>
