					<p>As a hybrid UI/UX designer with a robust foundation in front-end development (ReactJS, Angular, Astro Build) and graphic design (visual identity, illustration, native & web UI/UX), I'm passionate about blending creativity with technology. My drive for crafting intuitive user experiences and visually captivating interfaces sets me apart. I'm eager to take on a new challenge where I can lead creative teams, push the boundaries of design, and contribute to the success of forward-thinking organizations. Let's build something extraordinary together.</p>

                    <p>With over two decades of experience, my journey through web development began in 1998 as a hobby, evolving into a professional career by 2002. Over time, my passion for design flourished, leading me from web design in 2004 to becoming an interface designer by 2014. My creative leadership as a creative director, paired with a deep understanding of user experience design since 2016, has allowed me to craft seamless digital products. As a freelancer, I've worked closely with small businesses, designing and developing custom applications that meet their unique needs.</p>
                    <p>My creative roots trace back to childhood, where I began illustrating from comic strips, eventually transitioning to professional illustration in 2006. In 2012, I shifted focus from web design to programming user interfaces and front-end development, combining my artistic vision with technical precision to create engaging digital experiences.</p>
